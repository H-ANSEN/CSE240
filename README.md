## **M1 *(Module 1)***
- *[Programming Paradigms](https://github.com/H-ANSEN/CSE240/blob/master/M1/ProgrammingParadigms.md)*
    - aspects of programming languages at a conceptual level analizing the criteria we use to evaluate programming languages
    - breif history and reasoning behind the devlopment of diffrent programming languages
    - four main programming paradigms in use today
- *[Structures and Error Types](https://github.com/H-ANSEN/CSE240/blob/master/M1/StructuresAndErrorTypes.md)*
    - diffrent levels of structure that define and make up all proframming languages
    - error types associated with the different levels of structure that make up a program
    - [Syntax Graphs](https://github.com/H-ANSEN/CSE240/blob/master/M1/SyntaxGraphs.md) - an extension of how we quantify and define a programs structure
- *[Program Processing and Macros](https://github.com/H-ANSEN/CSE240/blob/master/M1/ProgramProcessingAndMacros.md)*
    - processing methodologies in that transform source files to binary executables
    - macros and their side effects *(with examples primarly in C/C++ language)*
